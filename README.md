# Project Title: Handwritten Digits Recognition

## Description:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution for recognizing handwritten digits, employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel alongside TensorFlow, pandas, and Matplotlib. While TensorFlow is utilized for deep learning approaches, SVM with RBF kernel offers an alternative method for digit classification, providing robust performance. The dataset of handwritten digit images is managed using pandas, enabling efficient data manipulation and preprocessing, while Matplotlib facilitates visualization tasks, aiding in understanding the dataset and model performance.
## Key Features:

1)Integration of TensorFlow for deep learning models and SVM with RBF kernel for digit classification.

2)Utilization of pandas for dataset management and preprocessing.

3)Application of Matplotlib for visualizing dataset samples and model performance.

4)User-friendly interface for real-time digit recognition (optional).

## Technologies Used:

1)Python

2)TensorFlow

3)Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel

4)Pandas

5)Matplotlib

6)OpenCV (optional for image preprocessing)

## Potential Extensions:
